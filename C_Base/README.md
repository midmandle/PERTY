# PERTY

PERTY SUMMARY:

- Collaborative cloud-based time management and task scheduling tool.
- Uses the concept of PERT https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_evaluation_and_review_technique#Management_tools to make task time estimates.
- Combines PERT with a simple scheduling algorithm which prioritises tasks which have the most impact in the shortest time.

FUTURE WORK:

- Fully implemented in cloud using OpenFaaS (Docker/Kubernetes etc.).
- Machine Learning solution to improve estimates using a regression based learning model.
- Collaborative user interface.
